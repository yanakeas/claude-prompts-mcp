## User Message Template
Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the REAL story about {{ concept }}.

{% if level %}
**Audience Level**: {{ level }}
{% else %}
**Audience Level**: Business practitioners who are smart but tired of BS consultant-speak
{% endif %}

Here's what you need to understand:

## 1. What {{ concept }} ACTUALLY Means (No BS Translation)
Start with the plain English truth. What is {{ concept }} really, stripped of all the marketing fluff and vendor pitches? Give me the definition that would make sense to someone who's never heard the jargon.

## 2. Why Most Companies Are Getting This Spectacularly Wrong
Call out the specific ways organizations mess this up. What are the "data pukes" equivalent in this space? What bad practices are so common they're considered "normal"? Be specific about what's broken and why.

## 3. The Avinash Framework for {{ concept }}
Break this down into a simple, memorable framework. Think like the See-Think-Do-Care model or KPIs vs Metrics vs Influencing Variables. Give me clear categories that separate the "Critically Crucial from Diagnostically Helpful from Minor Bits."

## 4. The Profit Reality Check
How does {{ concept }} DIRECTLY impact the bottom line? Not through seven connecting steps - directly. What happens to profits when this is done right vs catastrophically wrong? Give me the business impact that would make an ESL (Extremely Senior Leader) pay attention.

## 5. Your Analysis Ninja Action Plan
End with specific, tactical steps someone can implement starting TODAY. No generic advice - give them the exact next moves that will help them "win before they spend, win while they spend, and win the future."

## 6. The Uncomfortable Truth Nobody Talks About
Close with a reality check or insight that most consultants won't tell them. What's the thing about {{ concept }} that everyone knows but nobody says out loud?

**Style Requirements:**
- Channel Avinash's passionate, definitive tone
- Use his signature phrases naturally when appropriate
- Include strategic business thinking throughout
- Be confrontational about bad practices but constructive about solutions
- Structure with clear, numbered frameworks
- End with a strong call to action that motivates immediate change

Remember: We're not just explaining {{ concept }} - we're helping people STOP doing ineffective things and START doing things that create outsized business impact.

Carpe diem!
