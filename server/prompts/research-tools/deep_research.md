# Deep Research Framework

I need you to conduct deep research on {topic}. Approach this as a professional researcher would, with methodical analysis, critical thinking, and intellectual honesty.

## Research Structure

1. **Topic Exploration (Breadth)**
   - Define the core concepts, terminology, and scope
   - Map the key areas, sub-topics, and domains of knowledge
   - Identify the major schools of thought and contrasting perspectives
   - Establish historical context and evolution of understanding

2. **Literature Review Simulation**
   - Reconstruct what the primary literature likely contains
   - Identify seminal works, key researchers, and influential studies
   - Summarize the state of evidence across different perspectives
   - Note methodological strengths, limitations, and gaps

3. **Critical Analysis (Depth)**
   - Examine underlying assumptions and theoretical frameworks
   - Evaluate the strength of evidence and quality of methodologies
   - Identify potential biases, limitations, and alternative explanations
   - Explore counterarguments and dissenting viewpoints

4. **Synthesis & Integration**
   - Connect findings across different domains and perspectives
   - Identify patterns, relationships, contradictions, and open questions
   - Develop integrative frameworks that accommodate multiple viewpoints
   - Highlight areas of consensus and persistent controversies

5. **Practical Applications**
   - Translate theoretical findings into practical implications
   - Identify real-world applications and relevance
   - Consider ethical dimensions and societal impacts
   - Present actionable insights and recommendations

## Intellectual Virtues

Throughout your research, embody these intellectual virtues:
- **Epistemic humility**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty
- **Intellectual honesty**: Represent evidence fairly, even when it contradicts initial hypotheses
- **Steelmanning**: Present the strongest version of competing perspectives
- **Nuance-seeking**: Avoid oversimplification and recognize complexity
- **Falsifiability**: Be open to evidence that could disprove your conclusions

## Research Quality Guidelines

- Clearly distinguish between:
  - Well-established knowledge (high confidence)
  - Provisional conclusions (moderate confidence)
  - Speculations and hypotheses (low confidence)
  - Unknown areas requiring further investigation

- For controversial claims:
  - Present multiple perspectives fairly
  - Examine the best evidence and arguments on each side
  - Avoid false equivalence between positions with vastly different evidence
  - Identify consensus views while acknowledging legitimate dissent

## Output Format

Present your research using this structured format:

1. **Executive Summary**: Concise overview of key findings, themes, and conclusions
2. **Knowledge Map**: Visual or structured representation of the topic landscape
3. **Core Analysis**: Detailed exploration of each major aspect, presenting evidence and multiple perspectives
4. **Synthesis**: Integrative framework connecting different aspects of the research
5. **Applications & Implications**: Practical relevance and potential applications
6. **Research Limitations**: Honest assessment of constraints and knowledge gaps
7. **Further Investigation**: Promising directions for additional research

Begin your research by first clarifying your understanding of the topic and proposed approach.
